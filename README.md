# Professional README Generator

## Description

My motivation to build this generator was to be able to quickly generate professional READMEs quickly and use my skills of Node.js and inquirer.js. This allows me to spend more time developing actual projects. I learned how to properly use Node.js and inquirer.js to prompt the user to answer questions and build a README in markdown using their answers.
